## Conclusion

Recommender systems have become a cornerstone of online life; they help us navigate an overwhelming amount of information. Being able to predict a user’s interests based on an online session is a highly relevant problem in practice. There is not, however, a one-size-fits-all model; each solution will ultimately be unique to the use case, and care must, as always, be taken in the development and assessment of the model, in order to provide recommendations that will help users and businesses alike. Careful development and assessment of any machine learning model is critical, but it is especially true with recommender systems in general, and session-based recommenders in particular. The best approach is to first benchmark several options on offline metrics (such as Recall@K), and then perform online evaluation (through A/B testing, for example,) before settling on a given model—, as offline metrics typically cannot be used to properly assess real-world KPIs (like revenue generation or watch time). 

For this report, we experimented with an NLP-based algorithm—word2vec—which is known for learning low-dimensional word representations that are contextual in nature. We applied it to an e-commerce dataset containing historical purchase transactions, to learn the structure induced by both the user’s behavior and the product’s nature to recommend the next item to be purchased. While doing so, we learned that hyperparameter choices are data- and task-dependent, and especially, that they differ from linguistic tasks; what works for language models does not necessarily work for recommendation tasks.

That said, our experiments indicate that in addition to specific parameters (like negative sampling exponent, the number of negative samples, and context window size), the number of training epochs greatly influences model performance. We recommend that word2vec be trained for as many epochs as computational resources allow or until performance on a downstream recommendation metric have plateaued. 

The future is bright for session-based recommender systems. Research continues to push the boundaries, providing more powerful recommendation models and more efficient hyperparameter optimization methods. These, in turn, will pave the way for increasingly useful and powerful recommenders.
