## Overall Considerations

The definition of a session is crucial to building a successful session-based recommendation system, but this is not always an easy task. Sessions should be determined based on the structure and type of data collected, as well as the use case or problem at hand. Will the sessions be determined from online browsing history, transactions, rated items, or all of the above? How long should a session be? What determines the session boundary? (For instance, if a user is browsing items on the web, sessions could be delineated based on user inactivity.) All of these questions introduce a number of challenges in designing session-based recommenders. The rest of this section summarizes the challenges associated with session-based recommendation systems across various session definitions: length, ordering, anonymous vs. non-anonymous, structure, user actions captured, etc.

Session-related issues
What is more important: a user’s long-term intent or a short-term intent? To this end, we need to consider session lengths while defining the problem. Session lengths can be roughly categorized into three types: long (> 10 interactions), medium (4-9 interactions) and short (<4 interactions). While more interactions could provide more contextual information, they may also introduce noise, leading to  poor performance. Similarly, shorter sessions yield only a limited amount of information and, consequently, less context. Based on empirical evidence, medium sessions generally are better at capturing enough contextual information without including too much irrelevant information. This is especially true for transactional data in the ecommerce industry. Selecting an appropriate time span for sessions is domain-dependent, and comes with certain assumptions.

Sessions can also be ordered or unordered, meaning that the user's interactions may or may not actually capture when the interaction happens. For instance, when shopping online, the order in which a user adds items to their cart may not carry any meaning. Conversely, the sequence of songs listened to may actually matter, reflecting the mood and interests of the user in real time. Such situations warrant looking into appropriate modeling approaches; in some cases co-occurrence based approaches might work better than sequence models, depending on whether the entries are ordered or unordered.

Another big challenge for session-based recommenders is how to effectively learn from different actions by the user (for instance, how to differentiate between a user’s browsing activity and their purchase activity). Should the session contain only the items that were clicked on? Or should the various actions be combined? If so, how does one model such complex dependencies?
